Hi,

In a few hours, I developed a simple application that shows articles, and when clicked, it goes a detail.
- I used MVVM architecture, 
- Json decodable objects to use the API 
- Swift 5, of course 
- A simple demo of UI tests which tests the navigation,
- A complete scale of Unit tests which test API , Tableview and Cells , and the tiny logic used.
- Dynamic content height using Auto layouts (have bugs , it will be improved)
- Some documentation. 
- Caching for the images, which is a vanilla approach 
( But it would be better using known frameworks, and maybe it would better to small the photos)

Best
